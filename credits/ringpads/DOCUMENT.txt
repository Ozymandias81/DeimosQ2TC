Place on map and use the second and third arguments to control the intensity and area of the 
spawner.

First argument controls nothing yet

Second argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, spawns in a 64x64 diameter circle.

Third argument controls the speed of the rings (can also be negative if you want them to
move downwards instead of upwards)

It should be noted that pngs can't be translated like normal graphics. Because of this, if
you convert the SPFXA0 sprite to a png, the spawners will spawn white effects. Use Doom's
lmp format, instead.
