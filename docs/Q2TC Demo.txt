Description             : “Quake 2 TC” Is a TC for Doom 2 that runs solely on GZDoom. 

			  It uses all the original textures from Quake 2 on their original
			  rendition as well as most of the ambient sounds of the game.
			  The TC runs with the outstanding “Quake 2 Stuff” mod that brings
			  all the weapons and enemies straight from the game into GZDoom with total accuracy.

			  The music comes from the Quake 2 port of Nintendo 64, composed by Aubrey Hodges.

			  My aim is to create a near perfect recreation of a ID Tech 2/Quake 2
			  level or expansion pack but with the Doom engine, enhanced and made possible
			  only with GZDoom. Despite a few structural features and effects that are only
			  possible on the Quake 2 engine, the results are near identical and that proves again
			  how an ancient engine like Doom is capable to reach a similar level of technical
			  capabilities with ease.

Plot                    : After the successful "Operation Alien Overlord",
			  the USCM runs a global invasion of the planet Stroggos,
			  the core and heart of the Strogg populated solar system.
			  But while the Human forces are concentrated on Stroggos,
			  the remaining Stroggs on the other planets regroup and
			  start a new empire led by Zigurath, a new and more powerful Makron.

			  Desperate to launch a counter assault to the newly formed Strogg forces,
			  the marines launch a planetary wide scale assault to the rest of the
			  Strogg system in order to crush the new threat.

			  Gunned down by the bunkers located on the outskirts of a remote planet
			  that serves as an outer stronghold, you must now travel through the
			  various Strogg planets and Warships that are between you
			  and the new Makron and destroy him.
