/*
So I decided to do an updated full-color Quake II megapack.
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure the two official mission packs
contributed anything new after I finished pruning the duplicates.
Either way, listing them to be safe. Also, skyboxes are available
in a seperate archive. Message me on Realm667 if you want 'em.

There may be some numerical gaps in the texture names. I did a
couple extra passes manually to check for stuff like animations
I may have missed and so on. Rest assured that everything is there.

While I can't speak for their quality as games, Juggernaut and
Zaero have some very neat textures... Too bad the games were
unlicensed. Oh well! Have fun! --Ceeb
